# Luar: Lua reflection bindings for Go

Luar is designed to make using Lua from Go more convenient. Go structs, slices
and maps can be automatically converted to Lua tables and vice-versa. The
resulting conversion can either be a copy or a proxy. In the latter case, any change
made to the result will reflect on the source.

Any Go function can be made available to Lua scripts, without having to write
C-style wrappers.

Luar support cyclic structures (`map[string]interface{}`, lists, etc.).

User-defined types can be made available to Lua as well: their exported methods
can be called and usual operations such as indexing or arithmetic can be
performed.

See the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/stevedonovan/luar) for usage
instructions and examples.

# Installation

# REPL

Version 1.x features an example REPL that is available in the `cmd` folder.

## Luar 2

This is a rewrite of 1.x with extended features and a cleaner API.
The main differences with the previous version:

- The function prototypes of `GoToLua` and `LuaToGo` are simpler and do not
require the use of reflection from the callers. The `dontproxify` argument is
gone, use `GoToLuaProxy` to control proxification.

- The `Copy*` functions and `GoLuaFunc` are gone, use `GoToLua` and `LuaToGo` instead.

- Use `Register` instead of `RawRegister`.

- `InitProxies` is gone since it was not needed.

- The `LuaObject` and `LuaTableIter` structure fields are unexported.

- LuaObject methods not only work on Lua functions but also on anything with a
`__call` metamethods. Idem for tables and the `__index`/`__newindex`
metamethods.

- Use `NewLuaObjectFromName(L, "_G")` instead of `Global`.

- `Lookup` and `Geti` gone. Instead the `Get` and `GetObject` functions are
variadic: each subfield argument can be any valid Lua key (string, integer...).

- Use `(*LuaObject) Call` instead of `(*LuaObject) Callf`. The protoype of
`(*LuaObject) Call` has changed in a fashion similar to `GoToLua` and `LuaToGo`.
`Types` is gone as it is no longer needed.

- Register `ProxyIpairs` and `ProxyPairs` instead of calling `LuarSetup`.

- Register and use `Unproxify` instead of `ArrayToTable`, `MapToTable`,
`ProxyRaw`, `SliceToTable` and `StructToTable`.

- `ComplexReal` and `ComplexImag` have been replaced by the proxy attributes
`real` and `imag`, respectively.

- `SliceSub` and `SliceAppend` have been replaced by the proxy methods
`slice` and `append`, respectively.
Slice proxies have the `cap` metamethod alongside `append` and `slice`.

- String proxies have a `slice` method just like slice proxies. They can be
looped rune-by-rune over with `ipairs`.

The range of supported conversion has been extended:

- LuaToGo can convert to interfaces and pointers with several levels of indirection.

- LuaToGo can convert to non-empty maps and structs.


# Luar v2

The v1 API suffers from several design issues:
The `GoToLua` and `LuaToGo` functions take a `reflect.Type` parameter, which is
bad design. Sadly changing this would break backward compatibility.

The v2 rewrite fixes the design issues, usability and other bugs. Overall it
greatly simplifies the API.

Check it out in the `v2` branch of this repository.
